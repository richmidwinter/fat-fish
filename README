Fat Fish
========

A Java library for generating descriptive error messages, e.g.:

		8 fat fish fly slowly
		
A simple, memorable String which won't scare your users away.

To get a Fat Fish error String just call:

		new FatFish().get();
		
Or, if you want to generate a repeatable String from an error code:

		Long errorCode = 999L;
		new FatFish().get(errorCode);
		
It's as simple as that. Fat Fish also includes Locale support.
